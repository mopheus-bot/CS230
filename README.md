Operating Platforms

The company TheGamingRoom wanted to expand their game titled "Draw It or Lose It"
  to additional platforms by creating a web-based version of the game. This needed
  to support one or more teams, have multiple players per team, generate unique
  identifiers for game and team names, and include only one instance in memory
  at any given time. I also focused on providing the most value to this client
  by using the most cost-effective strategy.
  
One thing that went particularly well when creating this document was the
  recommendation for which system architecture to use for this application.
  When analyzing the operating platform, operating systems architecture, storage
  and memory management, distributed systems and networks, and security, it seemed as
  though all roads led to utilizing both Windows and Microsoft Azure in conjunction.
  
If I could revise one part of this document, it would be the evaluation grid. I would
  dive in a little deeper and focus more on strengths and weaknesses specific to each
  operating system, as opposed to a broader approach. How could each of these operating
  system's strengths help our development? How would their weaknesses hinder us?
  
Developing around the user's needs is extremely important. Not only does it provide
  a better experience for the user, but it also provides the customer with better
  overall value. We can accomplish interpreting the userâ€™s needs and implementing them
  into software design by developing design constraints, and using user stories.
  
When approaching the design of this software, I started with the requirements from
  the company, i.e. what they expected to get out of it. I turned these requirements into
  design constraints, then was able to create a rationalize a UML diagram. After this,
  I was able to provide a recommendation for the company on which platform to develop
  and deploy on, as well as start to look at some of the code for this application. In future
  projects, I think this approach will be extremely effective.
  
Thanks for reading!
